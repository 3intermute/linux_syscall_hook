implement function hooking in arm

write your own kallsyms_lookup_name

trust zone
check if memory has been read by outside of THIS_MODULE

if this shit does not work, fprobe syscall table and then use __NR_KILL


not RE related but does anyone have the symbol names for ARM linux syscalls
i know that x86 has the __x64_ prefix and im sure ARM has a prefix as well
but i cant seem to find it documented anywhere
im probably not looking hard enough
i have found https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h
but trying to call kallsyms_lookup_name with "__NR_kill" returns null


need to add KASLR offset, thank god fg isnt enabled

need to get kernel entry point:

CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ABSOLUTE_PERCPU


The fine-grainness of FG-KASLR is imperfect, there are certain regions in the kernel that never get randomized. Here are the unaffected regions that are useful to us:

    The functions from _text base to __x86_retpoline_r15, which is _text+0x400dc6 are unaffected. Unfortunately, commit_creds() and prepare_kernel_cred() donâ€™t reside in this region, but we can still look for useful registers and memory manipulation gadgets from here.
    KPTI trampoline swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode() is unaffected.
    The kernel symbol table ksymtab, starts at _text+0xf85198 is unaffected. In here contains the offsets that can be used to calculate the addresses of commit_creds() and prepare_kernel_cred().


youre a fuckin g moron parse page table to find kernel base
