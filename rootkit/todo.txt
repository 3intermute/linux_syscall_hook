implement function hooking in arm

write your own kallsyms_lookup_name

trust zone
check if memory has been read by outside of THIS_MODULE

if this shit does not work, fprobe syscall table and then use __NR_KILL


not RE related but does anyone have the symbol names for ARM linux syscalls
i know that x86 has the __x64_ prefix and im sure ARM has a prefix as well
but i cant seem to find it documented anywhere
im probably not looking hard enough
i have found https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h
but trying to call kallsyms_lookup_name with "__NR_kill" returns null


need to add KASLR offset, thank god fg isnt enabled
